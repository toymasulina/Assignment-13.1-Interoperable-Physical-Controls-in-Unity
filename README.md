# Assignment-13.1-Interoperable-Physical-Controls-in-Unity

## Create interoperable controls within Unity.

Programming intuitive interactions for your XR experiences is extremely important because interactions are at the forefront of user experience. Intuitive user controls can make or break any application—controls that aren’t intuitive for the user can make for a frustrating experience. 

Follow along with the screencasts that cover the creation of physical hand controls in Unity to create your own controls. Once completed, please submit a brief screencast that shows your application correctly tracking hand movement input from your XR controllers.

The screencast should show:

- Two hand avatars and an interactable slider imported into your Unity scene.
- XR controllers tracking hand movements and translating that movement to the on-screen avatars.
- On-screen avatar rotation and movements lining up with the real-life hand movements.
- Hand avatars interacting with and manipulating the on-screen slider.

The Unity assets for this assignment were provided in the overview for this week. Make sure to follow along with the screencasts leading up to this to ensure you have everything you need.
